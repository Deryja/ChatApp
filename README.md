# ChatApp
Python chatting application
This is a simple chatting application made with Python socket programming.
It consists of a basic server-client method where the server takes in an array of clients, and the client side will connect to the Server.
Multiple clients can be run at the same time through "edit configurations" with various names, and send messages to each other.
